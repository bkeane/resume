          <strong>DevOps</strong> | HG Insights - <small>May 2018 - present</small>
          <br>
At HG thus far I have been responsible for using terraform to migrate physical
infrastructure to the cloud and assist developers by recognizing pathways to
enable productivity while increasing security, reliability, and repeatability.
Infrastructure-as-code requires new thought surrounding source control flow,
including test and CI/CD practices. I thouroughly enjoy this space as it benefits
from knowledge of traditional software pipelines and demands creative thinking
to achieve best practices in a domain with often unexplored constraints and
solutions.
