            <strong>Senior Infrastructure Engineer</strong> | AppFolio - <small>May 2021 - May 2023</small>
            <br>
            My role at AppFolio involved advising on and implementing incremental improvements to global infrastructure needs.
            I bin packed my time working within development teams, regularly contributing to backend services and APIs.
            Throughout my tenure, I created frontend user interfaces and implemented Infrastructure as Code solutions
            while collaborating across multiple development teams.
